    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p>
        Thorin and Company were a group of thirteen Dwarves, the Wizard Gandalf, and the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, led by
        Thorin II Oakenshield in TA 2941. Their purpose was to regain the lost Dwarven kingdom of the Lonely Mountain
        from the dragon Smaug. The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which
        kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the
        King under the Mountain when Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit
        on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and
        cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes
        prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an
        unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their
        party.

            <h3>Thorin II Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                Thorin II "Oakenshield", eventually called King under the Mountain or Mountain King, was the son of
                Thráin II, the older brother of Frerin and Dís, the grandson of King Thrór and the uncle of Fíli and
                Kíli. Thorin was best known for his deeds as leader of a company that infiltrated the lost Kingdom under
                the Mountain to take it back from Smaug and for leading an alliance of Men, Dwarves, and Elves in the
                Battle of Five Armies.

            <h3>Kíli &amp Fíli</h3>
            <p>
                Fíli and Kíli were brothers, the youngest of the thirteen Dwarves who set out with Thorin Oakenshield's
                company, along with Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins, to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug.
                Fíli and Kíli were the two most active Dwarves of Thorin's company, and apart from Balin, and possibly
                Bombur, they appeared more frequently as "individual" characters in J.R.R. Tolkien's novel than the rest
                of Thorin's companions, who were most often named only in "group" references to the entire company.

            <h3>Óin</h3>
            <p>
                Óin was a dwarf of Durin's Folk known for being a part of Thorin's Company in the Quest of Erebor. Óin
                was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin,
                the father of Balin and Dwalin. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the
                Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on
                the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood. Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet
                that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were
                usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company as they were the most skilled out of the others.
                He fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King
                Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of The Company of Thorin.

            <h3>Balin</h3>
            <p>
                Balin was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of Dwalin. He was one of the thirteen
                Dwarves who accompanied Thorin II Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain. A Dwarf Lord
                known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest friends and
                advisers. Balin was distantly related to him, and a descendant of the noble House of Durin. He later
                went to re-establish the Dwarf presence in Moria, but within five years it was overcome once more by
                Orcs, and he was killed there along with the rest of his companions.
